Reading source code is an underrated method for improving at programming.  

- Diving into the source is often the best way to debug a third-party dependency.  Best case, you solve your initial problem and/or submit a patch.  Worst case, you have more context to use when filing an issue.
- Given the accelerating pace of open source development, sometimes diving into the source is the *only* way to learn how a dependency works.
- Reading, or better yet building, the source can shorten the feedback loop and dramatically improve productivity.  This is especially true if the other party (maintainers on github, or "the other team" at work) is swamped and probably won't get to your questions any time soon.
- Reading the source code from prominent libraries is a great way to pick up design patterns and idioms from a given ecosystem.
