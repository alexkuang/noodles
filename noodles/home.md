Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I plan to share the output of my personal noodling on various topics.

I'm not really sure what this will be yet, but it's somewhat inspired by zettlekastens and the work of [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://www.mentalnodes.com/) and [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/).

For the exceptionally curious, I also keep the raw files in a [github repo](https://github.com/alexkuang/noodles).
