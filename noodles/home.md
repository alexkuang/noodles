Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I plan to share the output of my personal noodling on various topics.  This includes:
- [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C)
- Reading notes from books + other writing
- Useful technical snippets
- Stuff I've found myself repeating, so may as well have a URL for it.

Starting points:
- [[Books]]
- [[Software]]

For the exceptionally curious, I also keep the raw files in a [github repo](https://github.com/alexkuang/noodles).
