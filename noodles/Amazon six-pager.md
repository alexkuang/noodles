The story goes that one day Jeff Bezos decided to ban Powerpoint presentations from senior leadership meetings.  Instead, meeting owners should write out a narrative document for the meeting in long form.  This document is read silently at the beginning of the meeting and serves as a base for the discussion.  Eventually this process evolved into the present form of the "six-pager."

### Why narrative documents
The narrative doc process started when the Amazon team noticed the shortcomings of PowerPoint in facilitating meeting discussion.  [[Working Backwards - Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon|Working Backwards]] credits Tufte's "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within" as the initial inspiration for replacing PowerPoint with long form narrative documents.

Narrative docs have the following advantages:
- Long form documents are denser in information, versus PowerPoints which are usually bullet points and filler graphics.
- Sloppy thinking and lack of nuance is much easier to hide in a set of slides than in long form writing.  The act of writing forces the author to work much harder to synthesize their ideas.
- PowerPoints have limited reusability, whereas full docs are often living artifacts and can be reused to get people up to speed on a given topic.  Docs require more work up front, but provide long-term returns if done well.

### The Doc
#### Length
The document should be tailored to the meeting.  [[Working Backwards - Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon|Working Backwards]] cites the six page limit as a function of meeting length: assuming an average reading speed of one page per three minutes, a meeting length of 60 minutes, and a reading time allowance of 33% (20 min), we come out to six pages as the best length.  It follows that e.g. a 30 minute should target three pages instead.

#### Structure
The structure of the document contents also vary based on the meeting and purpose.  Two commonly mentioned types are the Operation Plan (OP1, OP2) and the PR/FAQ.

##### OP docs
OP docs describe a six-month operational plan for a given area of business.  A typical structure:
- Intro
- Goals: what does success look like + relevant data
- Tenets: the foundational principles behind the specifics of the plan, preferably tying back to core Amazon principles
- State of the business: what are we currently doing, how are things going + relevant data
- Lessons learned: what we've learned from the state of the business in the previous period
- Strategic priorities: the details of the plan itself, what we plan on doing next (usually 50-70% of the doc)

##### Press Release/FAQs
PR/FAQs "work backwards" by starting with a press release for a given initiative.  They typically follow this structure:
- The PR is usually a few paragraphs and always less than one page
	- heading: name of the product
	- subheading: one sentence describing customer + why they care
	- summary paragraph: short summary of product and benefit
	- problem paragraph: describe the problem the product is designed to solve
	- solution paragraph(s): go into product in more detail and exactly how it solves the problem
	- quotes and getting started: one quote from the company, one quote from a customer describing how awesome the product is and how to get it
- FAQs should be five pages or less
	- External FAQs are addressed to potential customers and press.  These vary heavily depending on the product:
		- How much does it cost
		- How does it work
		- How do I buy it / do I have to get it installed
		- What else do I need
	- Internal stakeholder FAQs are a bit more structured, typically:
		- Addressable market: who are the customers, how much will they spend
		- Economics: how much are we willing to spend, what do margins look like now and in 5 years
		- Dependencies: what third-parties will this depend on and how are we managing that
		- Feasibility: how hard is it to execute, do we have the expertise or plans to develop expertise

#### Other best practices
- Docs are usually written by teams.  One person on the team is in charge of organizing and giving the doc a consistent voice.
- It usually takes about a week to put together a good doc.
- More is not better.  The page limit is a forcing function for choosing the most important parts to highlight and discuss.
- The doc should stand on its own and be legible to outsiders.  Someone should be able to read an OP doc and understand the plan without external sources.
- Accounts of formatting vary, but general consensus is 10 or 11 size Calibri, single space, narrow (1 inch?) margins on 8.5x11-inch/equivalent pages.
- The document should be a narrative.  Bullet points are used sparingly, and any graphs + charts go into the appendix.
- The page limit does not include the appendix.  The narrative should still stand without the appendix, but it is available for anyone who wants to dig deeper into the data.  In practice, there can be "six pagers" that are closer to 40 pages when including appendices.
- Strong documents don't just make an argument.  They also provide surrounding context and anticipate questions and counterarguments.
- Providing feedback on a document can be just as difficult as writing the document.  You're not just commenting, you're helping to set the direction of the idea and collaborating with the authors.  The end goal is a set of ideas that everyone can commit to.

### The Meeting
The process for the meeting seems consistent across various accounts.  The first third of the meeting is usually reserved for silent reading time.  Physical handouts are distributed, and computer use is generally frowned upon unless remote.  Notably, the narrative documents are *not* distributed ahead of time.  The reasons given for this structure are:
- Silent reading is much faster than a spoken presentation, so more information is processed in the same amount of time.
- Unlike a spoken presentation, reading allows readers to process information independently and dig into areas as they wish.
- A full read-through pre-empts any questions that are "answered later in the presentation."
- Just-in-time distribution allows the authors the greatest amount of time to work on the doc and ensures that everyone is working off the same version.

I suspect the dedicated reading time also allows people to transition from their previous mental context and be present in the current meeting.

Meeting best practices:
- Feedback should proceed immediately after reading time.  
- Everyone has just finished reading the doc, so there is no need for a separate oral walkthrough.
- Notes should be taken, preferably by someone who is knowledgeable on the subject.  The note-taker should not be the presenter, as they should be engaged in the discussion at hand.
- No brainstorming or ideation in review meetings.  Come in prepared.  Typically there are multiple prior reviews within the team before a formal meeting.
- After the meeting, notes should be distributed and any changes incorporated into the doc for the next round of feedback.  At Amazon, it's not unusual for docs to undergo > 10 internal reviews and > 5 formal reviews.
